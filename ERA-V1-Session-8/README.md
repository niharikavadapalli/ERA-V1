# ERA V1 Session 8

In this session, we build a neural network model using CIFAR10 dataset. We compare results using 3 different types of normalization methods such as Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization and Group Normalization with each of them acheiving more than 70% accuracy under 50000 model parameters and 20 epochs.

# Model Skeleton
